       <h1>Higher Stakes</h1>
     </div>

     <p> As Kings and Legends fall to the terrors of time, The Force finds a way to move on.</p>

       <p>After the fall of the First Order, and subsequently, Kylo Ren, the Sith fell silent. There was peace for years.</p>
        <p>There was no need for the ways of the Jedi, for without the Sith, there was no balance.</p>
     <p>Rey understood this, choosing to live her life as a recluse in the desert, much like Obi Won before her. There was tranquility for what seemed like a millennia.
</p>
<p>Yet peace does not sit well with the Dark Side of the Force. It craved destruction.</p>
<p>Its power rose from the fallen, to reach out and touch the minds of all who dared search for it.</p>
<p>With the red gas of the megafauna once concealing Exegol dispersing, scavengers and smugglers who were brave enough to venture that deep into the Old Space were rewarded with Old Imperial Tech, worth a fortune to Chroniclers and a corporation called Hive.</p>
<!-- <p>No one knows much about the Chroniclers. It’s been said that if you want to reach them, all you have to do is mention their name in whispers, they will come to you. For years, they have sought after ancient Sith and Jedi Relics. The Sith and the Jedi have all been wiped from history, save the relics that the Chroniclers cherish so dearly. They play in the shadows, while Hive operates in the light.
</p>
<p>Hive was founded by Amblo Serth, a bounty hunter turned businessman who always gets what he wants. He’s a notorious businessman, never backing down from a deal. There is a Hive operated store on almost every block of civilized planets. Almost every household item one would own would have the Hive Logo on it, three rings locked together, surrounded by an octagon. </p>
<p>Hive creates everything. From Ships to Weapons to even tooth brushes. Yet, recently, they have advertised a new product. For a rather large sum, they will bring back a loved one. With the lack of wars being fought, planets bounded together to form the Unified Scientific Institution, shoveling all funds once used for Army Tech to Scientific expansion. Two years ago, they announced that they successfully recovered material and research from the Planet Kimino. Now, for a large sum, one can go and bring a picture and ashes of a loved one and bring them back, at whatever age they like. They retain all their memories and return in peak physical form. </p>
<p>Yet there are murmurs of something dark lurking behind the production of the clones. The name Karr Nuq Sin has passed through whispers to meet our heroes ears...</p> -->
